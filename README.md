# Warhammer-40k-assessment-
Project introduction / overview:
This game puts you into the perspective of a space marine going throuh different systems. You already have your infomation in the system, so all you ahve to do is put it in and start the game. Bascially you pilot a small craft, figiting the disgusting xeno's and heretics. Your only objective is to get a high score and once you die, someone else will take over. Though there is a chance you might be put into a dreadnought. There are normal tyranid enemies and the occasional boss. Your score in reality means nothing for the thousands that have honorably perished befor you. You have the occasional shield and 3 seconds of immortality. Either way, praise the god emperor of man. 

What the project does:
Just a small alien shooter to kill aliens for a honorable cause. Based of a 90's and 2000's arcade game type of vibe.  

How to run the program:
You must absolutely enter your designation and pass key to activate the ship. Though your designation and pass key are anyways in the system so there is no need to register. Failure to do so will deny access.  

Project goals or purpose:
To dispose of the filty heretics and reclaim the galaxy through a fun arcade shooter.  

Installation or setup instructions:
Must have a designation and pass key.
